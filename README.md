### 🛡️ What I'm Focused On at Bindplane

At Bindplane, we're at the forefront of the OpenTelemetry standard, providing a robust observability pipeline that gives developers and security professionals deep insights into their systems. My role is to ensure the security and integrity of our products and the data they handle. This includes:

-   **Application Security:** Integrating security into the SDLC for our Go and React-based applications.
